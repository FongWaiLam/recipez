    comment: Thumbs up from my wife and daughter. Used Cauldron tofu and pressed all the
          water out. The sauce in particular is so good.

    comment: I marinated the tofu steaks first (thin not thick- 0.4/0.5cm) and cooked them 
          in my George Foreman grill with the spring onions. It needs something more, 
          maybe some mushrooms/veg but I would say that this could be a stunning 
          starter for a dinner and layer ingredients on top of each other for effect. 
          Lots of potential- almost there.

    comment:  easy to prepare. Used parboiled rice since I didn’t have whole grain. 
          The tofu could have been marinated in some of the teriyaki sauce. The
          burned on the grill so I would not recommend grilling for too long. All
          all a satisfying meal.

    comment: I exchanged chicken for tune and added 3 red chillies (I didn't have chilli
          flakes). Really good! Very filling even stumped my 20year old lad.

    comment: Not that easy or tasty. When I make it again I may have to 
          add a splash of red wine to the sauce.

    comment: I am going to make this and add oregano. But not sure you need the slow 
          cooker on for hours as you made the sauce in a pan then fried the meatballs 
          then to cook it for hours in a slow cooker? Would take less cooking time on 
          the stove as you've already cooked it.

    comment: Delish and a lot less faffy than fondants. The middle sinks into a crater
          while cooling. We scooped salted caramel ice cream into ours. Perfect.
